/*
In this headerfile we will derive the SimpleSocket class and implement Binding part of our server

Q What “binding” means in networking

On the server side, you must bind your socket to a specific IP address and port.
Example: "I want to listen on 127.0.0.1:8080".

Binding is done with the system call:

bind(sock, (struct sockaddr*)&address, sizeof(address));


Without binding, the OS doesn’t know which port your socket should listen on.


🔹 Why we need BindingSocket

The base class SimpleSocket is general — it creates a socket and leaves a placeholder function (connect_to_network) for “how to attach this socket to the network”.
